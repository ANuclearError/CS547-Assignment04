The purpose of this assignment was to utilise genetic programming in approaching
the problem of software cost estimation. When a software project is being
proposed, there are multiple factors that can influence the eventual cost of the
software. It can be difficult to determine which factors are more important to
consider, making this an appropriate search challenge in the scope of genetic
programming.

Using datasets provided, the primary goal was to identify which factors should
be taken into account to achieve the closest possible prediction to the cost
outlined in the file. Using various metrics, these estimations will be compared
to other methods that can be used to estimate costs such as linear regression.
